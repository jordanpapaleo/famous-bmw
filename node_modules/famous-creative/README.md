famous-creative
===============

A collection of helper functions and classes used by [Famo.us Creative].

## Info

We include a tagged version of the [Famo.us Platform], which allows use to control what version of the Famous Platform we are developing against. The code in our [famous-creative test] folder allows us to test our code and identify regression issues that may pop up when upgrading to the latest [Famo.us Platform] release.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to use our [Famo.us Creative seed]. If that's not your cup of tea, you can use the scaffolding code below or checkout the source code in our [famous-creative test] folder.

### Scaffolding a new app

```javascript
import FamousEngine from 'famous-creative/scaffolding/FamousEngine';
import View from 'famous-creative/display/View';
FamousEngine.init();

// App Code
FamousEngine.createContext('body');
let root = new View(FamousEngine.getContext().addChild());
root.createDOMElement({
  properties: {
    background: 'yellow'
  },
  content: 'Hello World'
});
```

## Release Management

We use the [git flow] model for branching, tagging, and cutting releases. The [changelog] feature from [git-extras] allows us to keep our crew informed every time we cut a new release. You can find those changes in our [CHANGELOG.md] and in our [famous-creative release notes].

> Please note that all pull requests should be made to the [develop branch].

### Installation instructions

- [git-flow]
- [git-extras]

### Cutting releases

> Replace any references of `<version>` with the [semver] number of the release you are about cut.

- Fetch all changes:
```shell
git fetch --all
```

- Pull the latest from `master` and `develop` branches.
```shell
git checkout -b master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b develop
git pull origin develop
```

- Start a new release:

```shell
git flow release start <version>
```

- Update the `version` number in the [package.json].

- Commit the changes to [package.json] with the following message:

```shell
git add package.json
git commit -m "Bumps version of package.json to <version>"
```

- Update the change log:

```shell
git changelog --no-merges --tag <version>
```

- Commit the changes to [CHANGELOG.md] with the following message:

```shell
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Updates changelog"
```

- Finish the release:

```shell
git flow release finish <version>
```

- Use the default message for merging `master` and `develop`

- When editing the commit message for the tag use the following format:

```markdown
Release <version>
* commit log a
* commit log b
* commit log c
```

> Pull the commit logs from the latest CHANGELOG.md entries.

- Push all changes to remote for `master`, `develop` and tags.

```shell
git push --all origin
git push --tags
```
